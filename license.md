# CC0 1.0 Universal

## Statement of Purpose

The laws of many jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer exclusive copyright and related rights (defined below) upon the creator and subsequent owner of an original work of authorship or database (each, a “Work”).

Certain creators desire to relinquish those rights with respect to their Works to the fullest extent permitted by law. To that end, creators who apply CC0 to a Work are waiving all of their copyright and related rights in the Work to the fullest extent permitted by law across the globe.

CC0 is a public dedication tool, and not a license. Accordingly, it does not create a contract between the person applying CC0 to a Work and any third party. Rather, it is an affirmative act of relinquishing all copyright and related rights in the Work.

Anyone is free to copy, modify, distribute, and perform the Work, even for commercial purposes, all without asking permission.

## No rights reserved.

In no way are the patent or trademark rights of any person affected by CC0, nor are the rights that other persons may have in the Work or in how the Work is used, such as publicity or privacy rights.

Unless expressly stated otherwise, the person who associated a Work with this deed makes no warranties about the Work, and disclaims liability for all uses of the Work, to the fullest extent permitted by law.

When citing the Work, you should not imply endorsement by the author or the affirmer.
